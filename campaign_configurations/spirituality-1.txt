spirituality

Here, we discuss such things as personal transformation
, the meaning of life, death, and moments of clarity. There is no single, widely-agreed def
inition of spirituality. Many people gravitate toward spirituality to seek religious-like u
nderstandings without the ideological constraints of institutional religion. This community
, however, is open to everyone, religious and non-religious alike. Join us in finding our p
lace in the universe. ðŸŒŒ

Spiritual is the exploration and connection to a higher pow
er or inner self, often involving personal growth, enlightenment, and a sense of purpose an
d meaning in life.
In Mindfulness communities, conversations about spiritual often revolve around topics such 
as the role of psychedelics in spiritual experiences, the validity and trustworthiness of s
piritual realizations, personal experiences of intense spiritual awakenings, the potential 
impact of extraterrestrial beings on spiritual beliefs, spiritual warfare, the challenges a
nd withdrawal from spiritual awakening, the intersection of spirituality and logic, the imp
act of staying spiritual on life's difficulties, the existence of a hospice for the soul, a
lternative concepts of god and prayer, the perceived lack of spirituality in contemporary s
piritual practices, and discussions about the nature of reality beyond conventional spiritu
al ideas.
